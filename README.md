# Thread Shed Project

## Part of 'Learn Python 3 - Codecademy Projects'

I have been brought in to modernize the operations of Thread Shed, a local sewing hobby shop. Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales. All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased and the date of sale are all recorded in this same string. I will employ my Python programming skills, to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier to access lists.
